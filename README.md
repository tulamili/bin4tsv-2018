Sofware name : 
  - "bin4tsv" ; my original internal code name, considering the rule of CPAN library naming rule. 
  - "Kabutomushi"  ; my colleagues call so. 
  - Still not fixed, though. 


Installation : 
  1. Requires Perl 5 installation beforehand. 5.1 is minimum, 5.14 or more is desirable. 
  2. The simplest way to use my software is just copy and paste each of the programs of my software. 
  3. Full installation is downloding the whole and adding the PATH of each of directory where the 
       program files of my software exists. But this may require faliarity of basic command line using knowledge.
  3. Some of the programs I created requires additional installation of necessary libraries from CPAN. 
       (The error message would show that the additional installation is necessary when you use the program.)

Bugs : 
  * Please report to me if you find some essential bugs. 
  * At this moment, multiple checking is recommendable. 
  * Not-hiding potential-bug policy is employed for my software at this moment.
